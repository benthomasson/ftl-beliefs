# beliefs

A CLI tool for tracking claims and contradictions across multi-agent LLM research systems.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install ftl-beliefs
cd ~/git/my-repo
beliefs install-skill
claude
```

Then inside Claude Code:

```
/beliefs init
```

## Problem

When multiple LLM agents work across repositories, their beliefs diverge. CLAUDE.md files go stale, claims get retracted without dependents being updated, and contradictions survive context compaction. Current LLMs have no mechanism for maintaining consistency across a knowledge base as beliefs change over time.

`beliefs` is a practical approximation of classical truth maintenance (ATMS, AGM) adapted for markdown-based agent workflows. It tracks what you believe, where each belief comes from, and what depends on what — so when something changes, you know what else must change.

## Install

No dependencies beyond Python 3.10+ standard library.

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install ftl-beliefs

# Or with uv
uv tool install ftl-beliefs

# Or run without installing
uvx ftl-beliefs nogoods
```

## Usage

### Initialize a registry

```bash
# Create beliefs.md and nogoods.md in the current directory
beliefs init

# With repos for cross-reference resolution
beliefs init --repos myproject shared-lib:~/code/shared-lib
```

### Track claims

```bash
# Add a claim with source, assumptions, and dependencies
beliefs add \
    --id auth-uses-jwt \
    --text "Authentication switched from sessions to JWT tokens" \
    --source backend/entries/2025/03/15/auth-refactor.md \
    --assumes stateless-api \
    --depends-on api-v2-design \
    --type DERIVED
```

### Detect problems

```bash
# Check that cited sources exist and are consistent
beliefs check-refs

# Find IN claims contradicted by newer entries
beliefs check-stale
```

### Resolve conflicts

```bash
# Compare entrenchment scores to determine which claim wins
beliefs resolve old-claim new-claim
```

### Query contradictions

```bash
# List all recorded contradictions
beliefs nogoods

# Find contradictions affecting a specific claim
beliefs nogoods --affecting some-claim-id
```

### Generate context summaries

```bash
# Produce a belief state summary within a token budget
beliefs compact --budget 500
```

## Data Files

**`beliefs.md`** — The claim registry. Each claim has an ID, status (IN/OUT/STALE), source file, date, assumptions, and dependencies. Hand-editable; readable without the CLI.

**`nogoods.md`** — The contradiction database. Append-only. Records what went wrong, when, and what it affected. Never delete a nogood.

## Six Operations

| Command | What it does | Classical source |
|---|---|---|
| `add` | Register a claim with assumptions and dependencies | ATMS (de Kleer 1986) |
| `resolve` | Resolve conflicts via entrenchment ordering | AGM (Gardenfors 1988) |
| `nogoods` | Query the persistent contradiction database | ATMS (de Kleer 1986) |
| `check-stale` | Detect claims contradicted by newer entries | Frame problem (McCarthy 1969) |
| `check-refs` | Verify source files exist and are consistent | Cross-reference verification |
| `compact` | Produce a dependency-aware context summary | TMS summarization (Doyle 1979) |

## Design Choices

- **Markdown, not YAML/JSON.** The registry is useful without the CLI — an LLM or human can read `beliefs.md` directly.
- **Keyword heuristics, not NLP.** Staleness detection uses keyword overlap and negation patterns. Crude but independent of the system being verified.
- **STALE, not auto-retract.** The tool flags problems for human review. It never changes IN to OUT automatically.
- **Nogoods are append-only.** Contradictions survive context compaction and session boundaries.
- **Zero dependencies.** Python 3.10+ standard library only. No LLM calls, no database, no server.

## Claude Code Skill

The repo includes a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill at `.claude/skills/beliefs/SKILL.md` that lets AI agents use the beliefs system via natural language. When the skill is loaded, an agent can:

- Run `/beliefs status` to get a full registry health check (check-refs + check-stale + compact)
- Run `/beliefs add <natural language description>` and have it converted to the right CLI flags
- Run `/beliefs show`, `/beliefs list`, `/beliefs update` with natural language arguments

The skill handles CLI discovery (installed binary → local script → uvx fallback) and interprets results — suggesting fixes for FAIL/WARN/STALE findings rather than just printing raw output.

To install the skill into any project:

```bash
# Install to .claude/skills/beliefs/SKILL.md (default)
beliefs install-skill

# Or specify a custom skills directory
beliefs install-skill --skill-dir .claude/custom-skills
```

## Origin

Built as a proof-of-concept during a meta-research study on using AI for open-ended research. The study found that multi-agent LLM systems suffer from belief staleness, circular verification, and cross-repository knowledge gaps — the same problems classical AI addressed with truth maintenance systems in the 1980s. This tool bridges those two worlds.

The design draws on classical AI belief maintenance and belief revision literature:

  The original justification-based TMS. Introduced dependency-directed backtracking and the idea that beliefs should be retracted when their justifications fail. The `compact` command's prioritized summarization is inspired by TMS dependency tracking.

  The assumption-based TMS (ATMS). Tracks multiple simultaneous worldviews via assumption sets. The `nogoods` database and `assumes` metadata on claims come directly from the ATMS design — a nogood is a set of assumptions known to be jointly inconsistent.

  The AGM framework for belief revision. Defines contraction (removing a belief with minimal disruption), revision (adding a belief while maintaining consistency), and expansion. The `resolve` command's entrenchment ordering implements AGM's epistemic entrenchment — more entrenched beliefs are harder to retract.

  Book-length treatment of AGM theory with epistemic entrenchment ordering. The entrenchment scoring system (`resolve`) — source priority + recency bonus + derivation type — is a practical approximation of Gärdenfors's formal ordering.

  Introduced the frame problem: how to efficiently represent what *doesn't* change when an action occurs. The `check-stale` command addresses the LLM version of the frame problem — when a source file changes, which claims are still valid and which need updating?
